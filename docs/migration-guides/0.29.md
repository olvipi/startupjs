# Upgrade 0.28 to 0.29

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.29`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

- **Select**: changed deprecated `Picker` from `react-native` to `Picker` from `@react-native-picker/picker`. Fixed as a patch error on Android with conditional rendering `Picker.Item` when using the `Select` property `showEmptyValue = {false}`, [issue on github](https://github.com/react-native-picker/picker/issues/175)

Install new library

```
yarn add @react-native-picker/picker
```

or

```
npm i @react-native-picker/picker
```

and install pod for IOS

cd ios && pod install && cd ..
